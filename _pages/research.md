Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract:</i> 
This paper explores how information asymmetry shapes the patterns of banks' geographic expansion. Theory suggests that, despite the removal of legal entry barriers, informational frictions can still hinder bank entry into the deregulated markets. However, the presence of "familiar" firms can alleviate this issue. Leveraging the US interstate banking deregulation as a natural experiment and comprehensive data on locations of bank branches and firm establishments, I find that banks are indeed more likely to expand to new locations with a stronger presence of "familiar" firms. These firms are "familiar" as they already operate in the bank's original neighbourhoods. And I confirm that banks likely have financial interactions with their neighbouring firms, using a novel dataset combining corporate loans with information on borrower and lender locations. I further document that banks' lending patterns in the newly deregulated markets naturally mirror their entry patterns, as credit provision is closely associated with the location of branches. Due to the informational barriers to entry, the statewide deregulation may not benefit all regions and firms equally. Areas where more firms are "known" to the banks from other states experience more entries and higher employment growth. Furthermore, small businesses may not benefit as much as large firms. These findings highlight the potential trade-offs of banking deregulation, and offer guidance for more effective and equitable financial reforms. <br>

The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: How do trade shocks affect non-tradable sectors? Banks may play a role. US banks located in areas with higher exposure to import competition from China experience slower growth in deposits and limit their lending to households. Contracted household demand in turn impacts employment in the local non-tradable sectors.

Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: Does government bailout save banks in crisis? US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program had a lower failure rate than non-recipients in the short run, but quickly caught up after the peak of the crisis. Recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher overall exit rate.
