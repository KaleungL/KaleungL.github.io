Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract:</i> 
This paper examines the role of information asymmetry in shaping the patterns of banks' geographic expansion. Theory suggests that, despite the removal of legal entry barriers, banks may still face adverse selection in the deregulated markets, which also deters entry and credit provision. The presence of familiar firms could, however, reduce information asymmetry. In this paper, I test this hypothesis using the natural experiment from US interstate banking deregulation. Combining comprehensive data on locations of bank branches and firm establishments, I find that banks are indeed more likely to enter a new location where more firms are familiar old neighbours&mdash;firms already operating in the bank's original neighbourhoods. To verify that banks do have superior information about their neighbouring firms, I construct a novel dataset merging corporate loan data with data on locations of bank branches and firm establishments, and confirm that firms tend to borrow from neighbouring banks. Furthermore, credit provision in the deregulated regions concentrates in locations with lower informational barriers of entry, and the concentration only increases over time. Finally, I document that informational barriers of entry lead to differential growth effects of deregulation across regions and firms.

The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: How do trade shocks affect non-tradable sectors? Banks may play a role. US banks located in areas with higher exposure to import competition from China experience slower growth in deposits and limit their lending to households. Contracted household demand in turn impacts employment in the local non-tradable sectors.

Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: Does government bailout save banks in crisis? US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program had a lower failure rate than non-recipients in the short run, but quickly caught up after the peak of the crisis. Recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher overall exit rate.
