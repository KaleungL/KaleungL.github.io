Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract:</i> 
This paper examines the role of information asymmetries in shaping the patterns of banks' geographic expansion. Theory suggests that, despite the removal of legal entry barriers, banks are still facing the problem of adverse selection in the deregulated markets, which in turn deters entry in the first place. The presence of familiar firms could, however, reduce information asymmetry. In this paper, I test this hypothesis using the natural experiment from US interstate banking deregulation. Combining comprehensive data on locations of bank branches and firm establishments, I find that banks are indeed more likely to enter a new location where more firms are familiar old neighbours&mdash;firms already operating in the bank's original neighbourhoods. To verify that banks do have informational advantage over neighbouring firms, I construct a novel dataset merging corporate loans data with data on firm establishment locations and bank branch locations, and I find that being neighbours is strongly associated with lending relationship. Furthermore, credit provision in the deregulated regions concentrates in locations with lower informational barriers of entry, and the concentration only increases over time. Finally, I document that informational barriers of entry lead to differential growth effects of deregulation across regions and firms.

The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: How do trade shocks affect non-tradable sectors? Banks may play a role. US banks located in areas with high concentration of manufacturing sector are exposed to import competition from China. They experience difficulty in raising deposits, which in turn constrains lendings to households. Contracted household demand thus affects employment in the non-tradable sectors.

Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: Does government bailout save banks in crisis? US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program had lower failure rate than non-recipients in the short run, but quickly caught up after the peak of the crisis. Recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher exit rate overall.
