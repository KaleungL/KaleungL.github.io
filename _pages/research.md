Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract:</i> 
This paper examines the role of information asymmetry in shaping the patterns of banks' geographic expansion. Theory suggests that, despite the removal of legal entry barriers, informational frictions from adverse selection can still prevent banks from entering the deregulated markets. The presence of familiar firms could, however, reduce information asymmetry. To test this hypothesis, I exploit the natural experiment from US interstate banking deregulation and leverage comprehensive data on locations of bank branches and firm establishments. I find that banks are indeed more likely to enter a new location where there is a stronger presence of familiar firms&mdash;firms that already operate in the bank's original neighbourhoods. To verify that banks do have superior information about their neighbouring firms, I construct a novel dataset merging corporate loan data with data on bank branch and firm establishment locations, and confirm that borrower and lender being neighbours increases the likelihood of credit provision. I further document that banks' lending in the deregulated regions concentrates in areas with lower informational barriers of entry, and the concentration only increases over time. In the aggregate, informational barriers of entry lead to differential growth effects of deregulation across regions and firms.

The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: How do trade shocks affect non-tradable sectors? Banks may play a role. US banks located in areas with higher exposure to import competition from China experience slower growth in deposits and limit their lending to households. Contracted household demand in turn impacts employment in the local non-tradable sectors.

Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither
</b></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
<i>Abstract</i>: Does government bailout save banks in crisis? US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury's Capital Purchase Program had a lower failure rate than non-recipients in the short run, but quickly caught up after the peak of the crisis. Recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher overall exit rate.
